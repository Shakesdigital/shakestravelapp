# Shakes Travel - Architecture Summary

## üéØ Project Overview

**Shakes Travel** is a comprehensive full-stack web application for booking adventure trips and accommodations in Uganda, inspired by the success of platforms like Booking.com and TripAdvisor. The platform focuses on adventure tourism including safaris, hiking, rafting, and cultural experiences.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Redux Toolkit + Material-UI
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js + TypeScript + MongoDB + Mongoose
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens + Social login
- **Payments**: Stripe integration
- **Media**: Cloudinary for image/video storage
- **Maps**: Google Maps API for location services
- **Caching**: Redis cluster for performance
- **Infrastructure**: Docker + Kubernetes + AWS/Digital Ocean

### **System Architecture Pattern**
Following TripAdvisor's approach with a scalable microservices-ready architecture:
1. **Phase 1**: Monolithic foundation (0-10K users)
2. **Phase 2**: Microservices transition (10K-100K users)  
3. **Phase 3**: Full microservices (100K+ users)

## üìä Database Design

### **Core Entities**
